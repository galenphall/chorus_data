## Data
The dataset used in the related paper is available online in the SPPQ Dataverse: https://dataverse.unc.edu/dataverse/sppq. To download it locally, run the `code/download.py` file. 

_Note that we will maintain updated versions of this dataset at a different location._ For replicating the results in the paper, please use the version of the dataset available in the SPPQ Dataverse.

## Code
The python code used to generate the data and figures presented in the paper is available in the `code` folder. Code used to create the CHORUS dataset is available for review upon reasonable request.

Files:
- `download.py`: Downloads the data from the SPPQ Dataverse.
- `load.py`: Loads the data into memory as pandas dataframes.
- `figures.py`: Functions to generate the figures presented in the paper.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for data analysis and plotting.
- `hbsbm.py` : Functions to create the hierarchical bayesian stochastic block models. When recreating results from scratch using `run_all_blockmodels_from_scratch()`, note that since the blockmodels are stochastic, the results will not be identical to those presented in the paper.
- `main.py`: Main file to run the code.

## Figures
The figures presented in the paper are available in the `figures` folder. The code used to generate them is available in the `code/figures.py` file. Note that the figures in the paper have been edited for clarity and aesthetics.

## Requirements
The code was written in Python 3.10 Most required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. To install them, run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt.
```
The hbsbm code also requires the `graph-tool` package, which can be installed via Conda but is not available on PyPI. To install it, follow the instructions [on the graph-tool website](https://git.skewed.de/count0/graph-tool/-/wikis/installation-instructions).
